Practical Assessment: Data & Loss Protection (DLP)
 
I will design a comprehensive ‘Insider Threat’ program to monitor and prevent employees from stealing and leaking sensitive data outside the Goodcorp organization. Goodcorp uses Microsoft Office 365 and the Microsoft Azure cloud. Internally, they use Microsoft SharePoint. 

Recommendation:
The first and crucial step in establishing an effective Insider Threat program is to ensure that identity and access management (IAM) is appropriately managed. IAM plays a pivotal role in the success of this program.

When it comes to DLP and data security, implementing measures to block access to USB flash drives can be both simple and cost-effective. By preventing employees from copying data to external USB flash drives and hard drives, we can establish an effective control measure that is technically free to implement. 

The next step would be to perform a data discovery activity to ensure the cybersecurity team has visibility over all data, including sensitive data. The focus should be on data related to Goodcorp’s controversial drug. The formula is stored on a Microsoft SQL database, the first location we should look at.

Next, search Microsoft SharePoint to discover any files related to the drug. 

Finally, all drug-related data should be tagged and labeled as highly sensitive using Microsoft Azure AIP. Since Goodcorp uses Microsoft products, a DLP solution from Microsoft is most likely the most cost-effective and easiest to implement.

Configure strict DLP rules to prevent sending or copying files tagged as ‘Highly Sensitive.’

Finally, a physical search on desks should be conducted to try and find any physical files related to the drug. They should all be kept in a secure file cabinet to reduce the risk of employees taking photos of sensitive files using their phones.
